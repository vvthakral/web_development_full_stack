<h1>This is my first tag.</h1>
<h3>By Vishnu Vansh Thakral</h3>
<p>Aristotle said, "Well begun is half done". Isn't it true?<br>
We tend to believe so, as beginning a project well means that not much effort is to be put in at a later stage.<br> Also, a good beginning can act as a motivation to keep on working towards the final goal with genuine dedication.</p>
<b>Did you know that using B to bold a text is no longer a good practice></b><br>
<strong>We use strong instead of bold. It basically means a little bit more! Makes sense right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
<i>Also, Italics is not by I.</i><br>
<em>Better is em tag which meaens emphasis.<br> I doubt why em!!! Maybe people didn't know the spelling :P</em>
